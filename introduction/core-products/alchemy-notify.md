### 2. :heavy_check_mark: Easy Integration

## :tired_face: Problem: Notifications don't exist in blockchain

* UX and lack of relevant notifications is one of the biggest inhibitors to the growth of blockchain apps.
* Getting the information required to notify users about web3 events is complicated and requires large amounts of dev time and extra infrastructure. 
* It’s impossible for developers to trigger notifications for important events like dropped transactions.

## :smiley: Solution: Alchemy Notify 

Alchemy Notify enables you to send relevant, timely notifications on the most important Web3 events with the following benefits:

* Starts working with a two-click creation process, doing all the hard work for you. 
* Has built in notifications for mined transactions, dropped transactions and smart contract events.  

## Features 

### :pick: [Mined Transactions ](../../guides/using-notify.md#mined-transactions)

Let your users know exactly when their deposits, purchases, in-game actions or other on-chain activity has officially occurred — the perfect time to re-engage and keep using your application.

### :hole: [Dropped Transactions](../../guides/using-notify.md#dropped-transactions)

Let your users respond immediately when transactions fail, eliminating the most frustrating part of blockchain UX. No more missed trades, lost auctions, or disappearing tokens.

### :money_with_wings: [Address Activity](../../guides/using-notify.md#address-activity)

Let your users know when transaction activity occurs on their address. No more refreshing the page or having to watch each new block and create custom filters to track user’s data. The Address Activity webhooks include notifications for:

1. [External Transfers](../../guides/using-notify.md#types-of-transfers)
2. [Internal Transfers](../../guides/using-notify.md#types-of-transfers)
3. [Token Transfers](../../guides/using-notify.md#address-activity)

### :fuelpump:[ Gas Price](../../guides/using-notify.md#4-gas-price) <a href="address-activity" id="address-activity"></a>

The Gas Price Webhook allows you to receive a notification every minute when the Mainnet gas price rises above or drops below a certain threshold that you can select.
