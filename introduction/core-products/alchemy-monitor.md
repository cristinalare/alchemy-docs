## :tired_face: Problem: Monitoring tools don't exist 

* Developers spend more time reacting to active issues than preventing them from happening in the first place, sacrificing nights of sleep in the process. 
* Because Web3 monitoring tools are non-existent, developers learn about errors at the same time as their users. 
* Traditional analytics fail Web3 developers, as they don’t capture all the data they need.
* Developers don’t have time to spend on deep integrations with new products.

## :smiley: Solution: Alchemy Monitor

* Collects and surfaces critical information about overall application health, making it  easy to catch and solve issues before they balloon.

* Gives developers deep and rich analytics to understand application performance and usage, and see in real time how optimizations are affecting these stats.
* Lets you see where in the world your product is being used, and how adoption is growing in different markets.
* Works out of the box with Alchemy Supernode, no additional effort required.
