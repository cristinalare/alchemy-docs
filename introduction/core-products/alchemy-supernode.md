* One-line infrastructure API
* 1,000+ engineering hours saved per year

## 😫 Problem: Nodes are hard  

The traditional Web 2.0 approach to scaling infrastructure uses multiple, indistinguishable servers managed by a load balancer, but with blockchain, applications can’t treat nodes indistinguishably because each node syncs and stores data from the blockchain asynchronously.

* Running nodes behind a load balancer may result in inconsistent data since the latest block on each node might be different
* Data inconsistencies force developers to introduce tons of complicated workarounds and lead to inevitable errors that crash applications and ruin user experience
* Apps that run directly on nodes suffer high latency and downtime because nodes are general-purpose and not designed to be highly available.
* Without a new approach to infrastructure design, developers are forced to choose between state consistency and scale.

## 😃 Solution: Alchemy Supernode

Alchemy Supernode is a new kind of infrastructure for decentralized applications with the following benefits:

* Ensures data is always correct, real-time and in sync thanks to a proprietary coordinator service
* Powers each piece of node functionality with a dedicated, distributed system -- the same systems used by Facebook and Amazon for achieving massive scale
* Scales quickly and seamlessly so you can spend more time shipping products and delighting users
* Includes enhanced API methods and upgraded WebSockets to continuously listen for changes and automatically handle reconnection and backfilling missed events
* One-line infrastructure API that not only does all the jobs of a single node, but also comes with the uptime, availability, and necessities to run a production application.

## Architecture

Alchemy Supernode's innovative architecture for web3 scales every piece of node functionality with dedicated distributed systems, and maintains real-time data correctness with a proprietary coordinator service.
