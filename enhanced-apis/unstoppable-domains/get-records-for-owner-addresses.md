## URL Params

* none

## Query Params

* `owners`: a list of wallet addresses to query for domains information. Note that if your request must include multiple addresses, and you need to use a new query param instance for each address. 
* `tlds`: optional parameter to filter domains by TLDs. Currently supported:
    * .zil
    * .crypto
    * .nft
    * .blockchain
    * .bitcoin
    * .coin
    * .wallet
    * .888
    * .dao
    * .x
* `sortBy`: which field to use for sorting of the list. Options are:
    * `"id"`: sort by domain id
    * `"name"`: sort by name alphabetically
* `sortDirection`: one of the following options: 
    * `"ASC"`: ascending order
    * `"DESC"`: descending order
* `startingAfter`: skip all elements before this value. Value dpeends on `sortBy` value. Use `nextStartingAfter` field from the response to get the next page of the list.

## Returns

A JSON object that contains a `data` field representing an array of domain details, along with some `meta` metadata about the request.

* `data`: contains a list of domain details. Details are the same as for GET domain response.
* `meta`: contains list metadata
    * `perPage`: number of elements in the list in single response 
    * `nextStartingAfter`: a value that can be passed in the startingAfter  query parameter to get the next page of the domains list
    * `sortBy`: which field is used to sort domains list
    * `sortDirection`: order of applied sorted (ascending or descending) 
    * `hasMore`: whether response has more domains to show in the next pages

## Example

Here is an example request to query for the records and metadata for two owner addresses:

1. 0xF5FFF32CF83A1A614e15F25Ce55B0c0A6b5F8F2c
2. 0x8aad44321a86b170879d7a244c1e8d360c99dda8

    "sortBy": "id",
    "sortDirection": "DESC",
    "hasMore": true
  }
}
```

The response has more data that is not included in the first page, so the query for the next page would use the `nextStartingAfter` response value:

```
curl \
--request GET "https://unstoppabledomains.g.alchemy.com/domains/?owners=0xF5FFF32CF83A1A614e15F25Ce55B0c0A6b5F8F2c&sortBy=id&sortDirection=DESC&perPage=2&owners=0x8aad44321a86b170879d7a244c1e8d360c99dda8&startingAfter=556766" \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR API KEY>'
```
