# ❗ Error Reference

## HTTP Status Codes

In addition to the standard [Ethereum JSON-RPC error codes](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/json-rpc-error-codes-improvement-proposal), Alchemy will return the following status codes for HTTP requests:

### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400  | Bad Request -- Your request is invalid. Double-check your JSON-RPC body.                                                                                                                                   |
| 401  | Unauthorized --  You must authenticate your request with an API key. Check out how to [create a key](../introduction/getting-started.md#1-create-an-alchemy-key) if you do not have one.                   |
| 403  | Forbidden -- You've hit your **capacity limit**, or your request was rejected by your app's **whitelist settings**.                                                                                        |
| 429  | Too Many Requests -- You've exceeded your concurrent requests capacity or [compute units](compute-units.md) per second capacity. Check out the [Rate Limits](../guides/rate-limits.md) page for solutions. |
| 500  | Internal Server Error -- We're unable to process your request right now. Get in touch with us if you see this.                                                                                             |

### Example Response

```javascript
// Example 429 Error
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "error": {
        "code": 429,
        "message": "Your app has exceeded its compute units per second capacity. If you have retries enabled, you can safely ignore this message. If not, check out https://docs.alchemyapi.io/guides/rate-limits"
    },
    "id": 1
}
```

## Standard JSON-RPC Errors

For JSON-RPC specific errors, Alchemy returns a `200` with the JSON-RPC error in the JSON response.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: -32000 is used for many server errors. Here are a few common examples:

`"already known"`&#x20;

* This generally means the transaction already posted and is on the node in a pending state. Sometimes this error occurs when transactions fail at first but are retried when the node already knows of them

`"Unspecified origin not on whitelist"`

* This error means whoever is making the request is not on the whitelist for using your API key.

`"filter not found"`

* Filters expire after 5 minutes of inactivity so if it's not found the filter likely expired.&#x20;

`"Request timed out. Client should retry."`

* Gateway timeouts (usually from nodes). Clients should retry the request.

### Example Response

```javascript
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "error":{
        "code":-32602,
        "message": "Invalid params: invalid length 63, expected a 0x-prefixed, padded, hex-encoded hash with length 64."
    },
    "id":1

### Custom Error Codes&#x20;

| Code | Possible Return message | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Unauthorized            | Should be used when some action is not authorized, e.g. sending from a locked account.                                                                                                          |
| 2    | Action not allowed      | Should be used when some action is not allowed, e.g. preventing an action, while another depending action is processing on, like sending again when a confirmation popup is shown to the user.  |
| 3    | Execution error         | Will contain a subset of custom errors in the data field. See below.                                                                                                                            |

### Custom Error Fields

Custom error `3` can contain custom error(s) to further explain what went wrong.\
They will be contained in the `data` field of the RPC error message as follows:

```javascript
{
    code: 3,
    message: 'Execution error',
    data: [{
        code: 102,
        message: 'Innsufficient gas'
    },
    {
        code: 103,
        message: 'Gas limit exceeded'
    }]
}
```

| Code | Possible Return message | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100  | X doesn't exist         | Should be used when something which should be there is not found. (Doesn’t apply to `eth_getTransactionBy_` and `eth_getBlock_`. They return a success with value `null)` |
| 101  | Requires ether          | Should be used for actions which require something else (gas or value)                                                                                                    |
| 102  | Gas too low             | Should be used when the value of gas given is too low                                                                                                                     |
| 103  | Gas limit exceeded      | Should be used when a limit is exceeded (for the gas limit in a block)                                                                                                    |
| 104  | Rejected                | Should be used when an action was rejected, e.g. because of its content (too long contract code, contains wrong characters, etc.)                                         |
| 105  | Ether too low           | Should be used when the value of Ether given is too low                                                                                                                   |
