There are three main avenues of support for Alchemy users: Discord, support tickets, and Telegram. We recommend checking the developer community discord if you run into issues or have questions before submitting a support ticket. &#x20;

## Developer Community Discord

Join our [community discord](https://discord.com/invite/mMGsVgd) for person-to-person support and a space to discuss blockchain related topics, ask questions, and engage with other developers. In addition, you can find Alchemy specific announcements and seek collaboration on projects. We hope this can provide a valuable knowledge base and support system for all blockchain developers, even beyond Alchemy users.&#x20;

Join the community using this [link](https://discord.com/invite/mMGsVgd), or from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io) by clicking on the "Get Support" button in the bottom right corner:
